        "Q1. What is Dimensionality Reduction? Why is it important?\n",
        " Ans. It reduces the number of features while keeping useful information. Helps avoid overfitting, improves model speed, and supports visualisation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Name and briefly describe 3 dimensionality reduction techniques.\n",
        " Ans. PCA: Reduces features using maximum variance.\n",
        "   T -SNE: Non-linear reduction for visualising high-dimensional data.\n",
        " Autoencoders: Neural-network-based feature compression.\n",

        "Q3. What is clustering? Mention 3 clustering algorithms.\n",
        "Ans. It is grouping similar data points without labels.\n",
        " Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Define anomaly detection and its significance.\n",
        " Ans.Identifying unusual data points that deviate from normal patterns. Important for fraud detection, system faults, and security.\n",

        "Q5. List and describe 3 anomaly detection techniques.\n",
        " Ans. Statistical: Uses probability distribution (e.g., z-score).\n",
        " Proximity-based: Uses distance or density (kNN, LOF).\n",
        " Model-based: Uses ML models like One-Class SVM, Autoencoders.\n",
